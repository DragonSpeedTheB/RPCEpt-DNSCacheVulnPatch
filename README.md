# RPCEpt-DNSCacheVulnPatch

Powershell script to create the vulnerable keys and change permissions on them
Inspired by: https://github.com/GossiTheDog/fixes/tree/main/RpcEptMapper

Can be used in a Configuration baseline in SCCM to deploy on a large scale for those still stuck with W7/Server 2008R2
